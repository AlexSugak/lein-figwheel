:CljsbuildOptions

A map of lein-cljsbuild options. Figwheel also uses the ClojureScript
build configurations found in the :cljsbuild options.

  :CljsbuildOptions [:CreateExampleMap :builds]

:builds

The :builds option should be set to either a sequence of build config
maps or a map of build configs. Each map will be treated as a
separate, independent, ClojureScript compiler configuration.

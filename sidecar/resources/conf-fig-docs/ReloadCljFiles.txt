:ReloadCljFiles

A Boolean or Map indicating which type of clj files should be reloaded
on change. Clojure source files on the a ClojureScript build's
:source-paths are assumed to affect ClojureScript build so there is an
attempt made to reload a Clojure and the .cljs files that depend on it
each time it changes. Set this to false to disable this behavior. You
can also enable and disable specific clj file types with a Map
Default: true

  :ReloadCljFiles [:CreateExampleMap :clj :cljc]

:clj

A boolean indicating whether you want changes to clj files to trigger
a reloading of the clj file and the dependent cljs files.

  :clj true

:cljc

A boolean indicating whether you want changes to cljc files to trigger
a reloading of the cljc file and the dependent cljs files. Setting
this to false is a common optimization if you are working with 

  :cljc false
